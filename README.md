3. Framework Usage Explanation
Why Frameworks Were Not Used
•	As a beginner in web development, the focus was on understanding the core concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
•	Frameworks like React or Angular, while powerful, abstract many foundational concepts, making it harder for beginners to grasp the basics.
•	By not using frameworks, the project is: 
o	Easier to understand and modify without steep learning curves.
o	Lightweight, with no additional dependencies or build processes.
o	Transparent in functionality, allowing direct control over every line of code.
•	This approach also helps in building a strong foundation, which is essential before transitioning to more advanced tools in the future.

5. Functionality (Simple Code Examples)
Dynamic Trip Display
The following code dynamically generates and displays trips:
const trips = [
    { id: 1, name: "Trip to Paris", description: "Explore the city of lights", price: "$1200", dates: "March 15-20", image: "https://source.unsplash.com/600x400/?paris" },
    { id: 2, name: "Trip to Bali", description: "Relax on beautiful beaches", price: "$900", dates: "April 5-10", image: "https://source.unsplash.com/600x400/?bali" }
];

const tripsContainer = document.querySelector(".trips-container");
trips.forEach((trip) => {
    const tripCard = `
    <div class="trip-card">
        <img src="${trip.image}" alt="${trip.name}">
        <h3>${trip.name}</h3>
        <p>${trip.description}</p>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> ${trip.price}</p>
        <button onclick="bookTrip(${trip.id})">Book Now</button>
    </div>`;
    tripsContainer.innerHTML += tripCard;
});
Filter Functionality
Users can filter trips based on price, date, or location:
filterForm.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    const priceFilter = document.getElementById("price-filter").value;
    const filteredTrips = trips.filter((trip) => {
        if (priceFilter === "low" && parseInt(trip.price.replace("$", "")) >= 1000) return false;
        return true;
    });
    displayTrips(filteredTrips);
});
Booking Confirmation
When a user books a trip, the available slots are updated dynamically:
function bookTrip(tripId) {
    const trip = trips.find((t) => t.id === tripId);
    if (trip.slots > 0) {
        trip.slots -= 1;
        alert(`Booking successful for ${trip.name}! Slots remaining: ${trip.slots}`);
    } else {
        alert("No slots available.");
    }
}

6. Conclusion
The Exploro Club website provides a functional and user-friendly platform for exploring and booking trips. While built using foundational web technologies, it demonstrates a clear understanding of dynamic content generation, interactivity, and user-centric design. The decision to avoid frameworks ensures simplicity and transparency, making the project accessible for further modifications or enhancements.
With additional time, the project can be extended to include real backend integration, advanced user authentication, and a payment gateway to make it a fully functional travel application.
